# Food Price Inflation :

**Introduction**:
            The dataset comprises estimates of food prices, aiming to capture local price fluctuations in regions where people are vulnerable to localized price surges. These estimates are generated using a machine-learning algorithm that predicts ongoing subnational price surveys, often achieving accuracy comparable to direct price measurements.

**Purpose**:
            The primary goal of this dataset is to provide a more accurate representation of food price trends in rural or impoverished areas, where traditional sources of consumer prices may face delays or offer only aggregated data. This information is valuable for policymakers, researchers, and organizations working in areas with large populations living in fragile conditions.
